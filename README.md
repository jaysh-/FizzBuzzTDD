## Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to gain familiarity with TDD principals using a relatively simple problem. Generally, the steps are
1. Write a failing test
2. Make the failing test pass
3. Refactor,

all while ensuring that a passing tests keep passing. This serves as regression testing and prevents the author from breaking working code if something comes up. 

The commit log serves as an abbreviated version of this process: commits were made once a new test was passing and after refactoring, excluding the failing test step. In hindsight, I think it would have been better to include the failing test step.
